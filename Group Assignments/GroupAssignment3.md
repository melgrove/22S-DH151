# Group Assignment #3 Choropleth map

Your third group assignment is for each member of the group to create a choropleth map that adds an important narrative element to your maproom. You may choose to create a entirely separate maproom, or add the choropleth as a layer in your existing group project.

Your final map should have:

- a title and description of the map and its data
- a geojson polygon layer
- one or more attributes to color the map with
- popup info panels to display information about features as you hover over them
- a legend
- a description of which group member was responsible for which layer
